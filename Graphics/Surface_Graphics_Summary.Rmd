# Introduction
This Notebook analyzes FOCB's "Surface" data. These data are pulled from long 
term monitoring locations around the Bay. Data, as suggested by the name of the 
data subset, is collected at the surface of the water. (Other data, from depth, 
are also available, but not evaluated here.)

These are sites visited regularly by FOCB staff, either by boat or on land.  The 
focus is on warm season sampling (April through October), with roughly monthly
samples.  Earlier data from some land-based sites was collected by volunteers.

This notebook focuses on developing graphics for the "State of Casco Bay" 
report, not on detailed statistical analyses. In particular, this notebook 
develops graphics showing current status of water quality at different 
locations.

The central design challenge is that we are trying to find ways to summarize six
(seven) water quality variables, measured at twenty three locations, over a
period of years.  We need graphics that are compact and easy to follow.  We also 
want the graphics to be directly comparable to the graphics developed to look
at long-term trends in these same water quality parameters.

This version makes several changes from the draft surface graphics notebook.  
First, is simplifies and standardizes Station names.  Second, it uses facet 
graphics to show status of six variables and it adds a temperature by dissolved 
oxygen graphic.  We also found ways to integrate transformed chlorophyll axes 
into facet plots, which we use her and in the companion 
"Surface_Trends_Graphics.Rmd" notebook.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Part 1: Load and Organize Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Primary Data
We specify column names because FOCB data has a row of names, a row of units,
then the data.  This approach is simpler than reading names from the first
row and correcting them to be R syntactic names.

```{r load_data, warning = FALSE}
fn    <- 'FOCB Surface All Current Sites With BSV Data.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

mynames <- c('station', 'dt', 'time', 'sample_depth',
             'secchi', 'water_depth','temperature', 'salinity',
             'do', 'pctsat', 'pH', 'chl', 
             'month', 'year', 'fdom', 'bga', 
             'turbidity', 'blank', 'clouds', 'wndspd',
             'winddir'
             )

the_data <- read_excel(fpath, skip=2, col_names = mynames)
rm(mynames)
```

### Remove 2020 only data
```{r remove_late_data_types}
the_data <- the_data %>%
select(-c(fdom:winddir))
```

## Add Station Names
```{r add_station_names}
fn    <- 'FOCB Monitoring Sites.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)
loc_data <- read_excel(fpath) %>%
  select(Station_ID, Alt_Name) %>%
  rename(station = Station_ID,
         station_name = Alt_Name)

the_data <- the_data %>%
  left_join(loc_data, by = 'station') %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station) %>%
  
  relocate(year, .after = dt) %>%
  relocate(month, .after = year)
rm(loc_data)
```

Our data contains two stations that are not associated with locations that were
included in our spatial data. Neither matter for the current analysis. They will
get filtered out when we select data to describe recent conditions.

## Address Secchi Censored Values
Note we do NOT use maximum likelihood estimators of censored Secchi depth,
as censored values are relatively rare, and do not affect median values, which
are our focus here. The key goal is to include observations with Secchi Depth
on the bottom, and include information on when the Secchi Depth may be biased.

```{r secchi_censoring}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(secchi_2 = if_else(secchi == "BSV", water_depth, as.numeric(secchi)),
         bottom_flag = secchi == "BSV") %>%
  relocate(secchi_2, .after = secchi) %>%
  relocate(bottom_flag, .after = sample_depth)  # we want an ID column
```

Warnings are caused because some entries in Secchi that could not be converted
to numeric values.  However, the warnings appear to have all been triggered by
existing NAs, not problems importing numeric values. (Not shown.)

## Create Recent Data
In 2015, we presented marginal means and standard errors for sixteen different
regions of the Bay.  This time, we have fewer monitoring stations, and choose 
to present results for each monitoring location individually.

We filter to the last five FULL years of data, 2015 through 2019, and add a
transformed chlorophyll value, to facilitate plotting.

```{r pull_recent}
recent_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(year > 2014 & year < 2020) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, temperature, median, na.rm = TRUE),
         station_name = fct_reorder(station_name, 
                                    temperature, median, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(chl_log1p = log1p(chl))
rm(the_data)
```

## Create Labels Tibble
To run parallel analyses on nested tibbles, we will need to reorganize the 
data so that we can analyze along parameters.  We add a list of labels and
measurement units to simplify later labeling of plots.

c('temperature', 'salinity', 'do','pH', 'secchi_2', 'chl_log1p'))

```{r create_nested}
units <- tibble(parm = c('temperature', 
                              'salinity', 'do',
                              'pctsat', 'pH', 'secchi_2', 
                              'chl', 'chl_log1p'),
                label = c( "Temperature",
                         "Salinity", "Dissolved Oxygen",
                         "Percent Saturation", "pH", "Secchi Depth",
                         "Chlorophyll A", "Chlorophyll A"),
                units = c(paste0("\U00B0", "C"),
                          'PSU', 'mg/l',
                          '', '', 'm', 
                          'ug/l', 'ug/l'),
                fancy_label =  c(
                  expression("Temperature (" * degree * "C)"),
                  expression("Salinity" ~ "(PSU)"),
                  expression("Dissolved Oxygen" ~ "(mg/l)"),
                  expression("Percent" ~ " Saturation"), 
                  expression("pH"),
                  expression("Secchi" ~ "Depth" ~ "(m)"), 
                  expression("Chlorophyll A (" * mu * "g/l)"),
                  expression("Chlorophyll A (" * mu * "g/l)")))
```

## Reorganize and Select Data
This is perhaps counter intuitive, because we "unnest" the nested data here.  An 
alternative would be to start from `recent_data` and pivot to long form, but 
this ensures we are looking at the exact same data used in our other plots.

```{r reorganize_facet_data}
data_long <- recent_data %>%
  select(-dt, -year, -time, -sample_depth, -secchi) %>%
  relocate(water_depth, .after = month) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(secchi_2:chl_log1p), 
               names_to = 'parm', 
               values_to = 'value') %>%
  mutate(bottom_flag = if_else(parm=='secchi_2', bottom_flag, FALSE)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(value)) %>%
  filter(parm %in% c('temperature', 'salinity', 'do', 
                          'pH', 'secchi_2', 'chl_log1p')) %>%
  mutate(parm = factor(parm,
                            levels = c('temperature', 'salinity', 'do', 
                                       'pH', 'secchi_2', 'chl_log1p'))) %>%
  mutate(fancy_parm = factor(parm, levels = units$parm,
                             labels = units$fancy_label))
```

# Part 2:  Faceted Graphics
It would be nice to wrap those graphics up in a faceted format, principally
to simplify axis labels.

## Draft Jitter Plot
```{r draft_facet_jitter, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
 p <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = station_name, y = value)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = bottom_flag), width = 0.3, height = 0, alpha = 0.5) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = function(.x) median_hilow(.x, conf.int = .5),
                 fill = cbep_colors()[2], color = "gray15",
                 size = .4, shape = 22) +
    xlab('') +
    ylab('') +
  
    scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors(), 
                       name = '', breaks = 'TRUE', label = 'Secchi On Bottom') +
  
    theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,
                                     size = 8,
                                     hjust = 1,
                                     vjust = 0),
          axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0, 'cm')) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_parm, nrow = 3,
               scale = 'free_y',
               labeller = label_parsed)
p
```

That is very close, but the Y axis for the Chlorophyll values are misleading,
since they are on a transformed scale.  Also, the colors are not
correct -- see below for a correction.

## Fixing the Chlorophyll Y Axis
A little Googling suggests there is no easy way to adjust the Y axis limits 
independently in a facet display. For example, see 
[here:](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11585954/varying-axis-labels-formatter-per-facet-in-ggplot-r)
for a partial explanation and a work around.

However, it **is** possible to define axis breaks and labels using a function.  
That allows us to create a function that will create appropriate scales if 
we can construct a function that provides different values depending on which
sub-plot we are in. The challenge here is that "facet" does not "know" which 
subplot we are in. 

We need to figure out which plot we are in based on the data passed to the 
breaks and label functions.  We can do that if the plot or plots we want 
to alter have distinctive y axis limits, as they do here.

The help file for `scale_y_continuous()` provides the option of setting
the `breaks parameter to:

> A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output 
  (e.g., a function returned by scales::extended_breaks())

Since we do not set the axis limits manually, we don't know what the axis limits
are.  Luckily, in our use case, we *DO**do** know that the upper axis limit for 
the (transformed) chlorophyll data is lower than any of the others.  Eyeballing 
the draft graphic, it looks like  the upper limit is around 5, while the next 
lowest maximum figure is well over 5.

A similar problem (and solution) faces setting the labels for the breaks. but
here, since we will have **set** the breaks, we can look to see if we have our
specific breaks, and if so, set the labels appropriately.  It's slightly
trickier than that, but that is the basic concept.

#### See also
`scales::breaks_extended()`
`scales::breaks_log()`

#### What Tick Labels Do We Want?
The inverse  of the `y = log(chl + 1)` transform is z = exp(x)-1.  We have 
two choices for how to handle the labels. We can stick with evenly spaced
divisions, and provide "correct" labels, or we an identify "clean" labels, and
place our tick marks at those values.

##### "Clean" Tick Values
```{r make_ticks}
a <- c(0, 2.5, 10 , 25 ,100)
log(a +1)
```

#### Create Functions
```{r make_funs_1}
prefered_breaks =  c(0, 1, 5, 10, 50)

my_breaks_fxn <- function(lims) {
  #browser()
  if(max(lims) < 5.1) {
    # Then we're looking at our transformed Chl data
  a <- prefered_breaks
    return(log(a +1))
  }
  else {
    return(labeling::extended(lims[[1]], lims[[2]], 5))
  }
}
```

We are cheating a bit here by plotting transformed data, but providing labels
that are back transformed.  That work is conducted by the labeling function.

A comment:  frequently, `brks` is passed with `NA` in place of one or more of
the candidate `brks`, even after we pass a vector of breaks. In particular,
"pretty" breaks outside the range of the data are dropped and replaced with NA.
This function needs to be able to handle that.

```{r make_funs_2}
my_label_fxn <- function(brks) {
  a <- prefered_breaks
  b <- round(log(a+1), 3)
  real_breaks = round(brks[! is.na(brks)], 3)
  if (all(real_breaks %in% b)) {
    # then we have our transformed Chl data
    return(a)
  }
  else {
    return(brks)
  }
}
``` 

## Revised Jitter Plot
```{r jitter_base}
p_jit <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = station_name, y = value)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = bottom_flag), width = 0.3, height = 0, 
              alpha = 0.15) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = function(.x) median_hilow(.x, conf.int = .5),
               fill = cbep_colors()[3], color = "black",
               size = .4, shape = 22) +
  xlab('') +
  ylab('') +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()[c(1,4)], 
                     name = '', breaks = 'TRUE', label = 'Secchi On Bottom') +
  scale_y_continuous (breaks = my_breaks_fxn, labels = my_label_fxn) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,
                                   size = 8,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   vjust = 0),
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0, 'cm')) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) ) )
```

```{r jitter_wide, , fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7} 
p_jit +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_parm, nrow = 3,
             scale = 'free_y',
             labeller = label_parsed)
```

```{r jitter_long, , fig.width = 3.5, fig.height = 9.5} 
p_jit +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_parm, nrow = 6,
             scale = 'free_y',
             labeller = label_parsed)
```

# Part 3: Final Problems and Resolution
We need to suppress some legend entries, and only show an entry for "Secchi on 
bottom".  

Interestingly, since we first developed these graphics, we updated `ggplot2`
several times, and it appears the updates altered the behavior of
`scale_color_manual()`.  That ended up changing the allocation of colors to
color scales, in non-obvious ways. Luckily the desired behavior can be generated
with `scale_color_discrete()`.

## Examples
Note we use `type = cbep_colors()` with `scale_color_discrete()`, not
`values = cbep_colors()`, as we did with `scale_color_manual()`.

```{r examples, fig.show="hold", out.width="30%"}
test <- ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(wt, mpg,colour = factor(cyl)), size = 3)
test +
  scale_color_discrete(breaks=c(4,8), 
                       name="Cylinders",
                       type = cbep_colors())
test +
  scale_color_manual(breaks=c(4,6,8),
                     name="Cylinders",
                     values = cbep_colors())

# But when we omit something from breaks, it gets replaced with the NA color
test +
  scale_color_manual(breaks=c(4,8), 
                     name="Cylinders",
                     values = cbep_colors())
```

Frequently, `brks` is passed with NA in place of one or more of the candidate
`brks`, even after I pass a vector of breaks. In particular, "pretty" breaks
outside the range of the data are dropped and replaced with `NA`.

```{r}
my_label_fxn <- function(brks) {

  a <- prefered_breaks
  b <- round(log(a+1), 3)
  real_breaks = round(brks[! is.na(brks)], 3)
  if (all(real_breaks %in% b)) {
    # then we have our transformed Chl data
    return(a)
  }
  else {
    return(brks)
  }
}
``` 

## Jitter Plot
```{r jitter_base_2}
p_jit <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = station_name, y = value)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = bottom_flag), width = 0.3, height = 0, 
              alpha = 0.15) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = function(.x) median_hilow(.x, conf.int = .5),
               fill = cbep_colors()[3], color = "black",
               size = .4, shape = 22) +
  xlab('') +
  ylab('') +
  
  scale_y_continuous (breaks = my_breaks_fxn, labels = my_label_fxn) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,
                                   size = 8,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   vjust = 0),
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0, 'cm')) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

```{r jitter_colors,fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6} 
p_jit +
  scale_color_discrete(type = cbep_colors()[c(1,4)], 
                     name = '', breaks = 'TRUE', label = 'Secchi On Bottom') +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3, alpha = 1))) +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_parm, nrow = 3,
             scale = 'free_y',
             labeller = label_parsed)

 ggsave('figures/surface_6_jitter_revised.pdf', device = cairo_pdf, 
        width = 6, height = 6)
```

Ultimately, the Secchi on bottom colors were sometimes distracting, so we make 
simpler versions too.

```{r jitter_no_colors, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6} 
p_jit +
  scale_color_discrete(type = cbep_colors()[c(1,1)]) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  
  facet_wrap(~fancy_parm, nrow = 3,
             scale = 'free_y',
             labeller = label_parsed)

 ggsave('figures/surface_6_jitter_revised_no_color.pdf', device = cairo_pdf, 
        width = 6, height = 6)
```
