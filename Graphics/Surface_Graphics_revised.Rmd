# Introduction
This Notebook analyzes FOCB's "Surface" data. These data are pulled from long 
term monitoring locations around the Bay. Data, as suggested by the name of the 
data subset, is collected at the surface of the water. (Other data, from depth, 
are also available, but not evaluated here.)

This notebook includes code only for developing final revisions of graphics for
the final draft layout of the State of Casco Bay chapter on bay water quality.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Part 1: Load and Organize Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Primary Data
We specify column names because FOCB data has a row of names, a row of units,
then the data.  This approach is simpler than reading names from the first
row and correcting them to be R syntactic names.
```{r load_data, warning = FALSE}
fn    <- 'FOCB Surface All Current Sites With BSV Data.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

mynames <- c('station', 'dt', 'time', 'sample_depth',
             'secchi', 'water_depth','temperature', 'salinity',
             'do', 'pctsat', 'pH', 'chl', 
             'month', 'year', 'fdom', 'bga', 
             'turbidity', 'blank', 'clouds', 'wndspd',
             'winddir'
             )

the_data <- read_excel(fpath, skip=2, col_names = mynames)
rm(mynames)
```

### Remove 2020 only data
```{r remove_late_data_types}
the_data <- the_data %>%
select(-c(fdom:winddir))
```

## Add Station Names
```{r add_station_names}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

fn    <- 'FOCB Monitoring Sites SHORT NAMES.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)
loc_data <- read_excel(fpath) %>%
  select(Station_ID, Alt_Name) %>%
  rename(station = Station_ID,
         station_name = Alt_Name)

the_data <- the_data %>%
  left_join(loc_data, by = 'station') %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station) %>%
  
  relocate(year, .after = dt) %>%
  relocate(month, .after = year)
rm(loc_data)
```

Our data contains two stations that are not associated with locations that were
included in our spatial data. Neither matter for the current analysis. They will
get filtered out when we select data to describe recent conditions.

## Address Secchi Censored Values
Note we do NOT use maximum likelihood estimators of censored Secchi depth,
as censored values are relatively rare, and do not affect median values, which
are our focus here. The key goal is to include observations with Secchi Depth
on the bottom, and include information on when the Secchi Depth may be biased.
```{r secchi_censoring}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(secchi_2 = if_else(secchi == "BSV", water_depth, as.numeric(secchi)),
         bottom_flag = secchi == "BSV") %>%
  relocate(secchi_2, .after = secchi) %>%
  relocate(bottom_flag, .after = sample_depth)  # we want an ID column
```

Warnings are caused because some entries in Secchi that could not be converted
to numeric values.  However, the warnings appear to have all been triggered by
existing NAs, not problems importing numeric values. (Not shown.)

## Create Recent Data
In 2015, we presented marginal means and standard errors for sixteen different
regions of the Bay.  This time, we have fewer monitoring stations, and choose 
to present results for each monitoring location individually.

We filter to the last five FULL years of data, 2015 through 2019, and add a
transformed chlorophyll value, to facilitate plotting.
```{r pull_recent}
recent_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(year > 2014 & year < 2020) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, temperature, median, na.rm = TRUE),
         station_name = fct_reorder(station_name, 
                                    temperature, median, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(chl_log1p = log1p(chl))
rm(the_data)
```

## Create Labels Tibble
To run parallel analyses on nested tibbles, we will need to reorganize the 
data so that we can analyze along parameters.  We add a list of labels and
measurement units to simplify later labeling of plots.

c('temperature', 'salinity', 'do','pH', 'secchi_2', 'chl_log1p'))

```{r create_nested}
units <- tibble(parm = c('temperature', 
                              'salinity', 'do',
                              'pctsat', 'pH', 'secchi_2', 
                              'chl', 'chl_log1p'),
                label = c( "Temperature",
                         "Salinity", "Dissolved Oxygen",
                         "Percent Saturation", "pH", "Secchi Depth",
                         "Chlorophyll A", "Chlorophyll A"),
                units = c(paste0("\U00B0", "C"),
                          'PSU', 'mg/l',
                          '', '', 'm', 
                          'ug/l', 'ug/l'),
                fancy_label =  c(
                  expression("Temperature (" * degree * "C)"),
                  expression("Salinity" ~ "(PSU)"),
                  expression("Dissolved Oxygen" ~ "(mg/l)"),
                  expression("Percent" ~ " Saturation"), 
                  expression("pH"),
                  expression("Secchi" ~ "Depth" ~ "(m)"), 
                  expression("Chlorophyll A (" * mu * "g/l)"),
                  expression("Chlorophyll A (" * mu * "g/l)")))
```


## Reorganize and Select Data
This is perhaps counter intuitive, because we "unnest" the nested data here.  An 
alternative would be to start from `recent_data` and pivot to long form, but 
this ensures we are looking at the exact same data used in our other plots.
```{r reorganize_facet_data}
data_long <- recent_data %>%
  select(-dt, -year, -time, -sample_depth, -secchi) %>%
  relocate(water_depth, .after = month) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(secchi_2:chl_log1p), 
               names_to = 'parm', 
               values_to = 'value') %>%
  mutate(bottom_flag = if_else(parm=='secchi_2', bottom_flag, FALSE)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(value)) %>%
  filter(parm %in% c('temperature', 'salinity', 'do', 
                          'pH', 'secchi_2', 'chl_log1p')) %>%
  mutate(parm = factor(parm,
                            levels = c('temperature', 'salinity', 'do', 
                                       'pH', 'secchi_2', 'chl_log1p'))) %>%
  mutate(fancy_parm = factor(parm, levels = units$parm,
                             labels = units$fancy_label))
```


# Part 2:  Faceted Graphics
It would be nice to wrap those graphics up in a faceted format, principally
to simplify axis labels.

We need to supress some legend entries, and only show an entry for "secchi on 
bottom".  Interestingly, since we first developed these graphics, we updated
`ggplot2` several times, and it appears the updates altered the behavior of  `scale_color_manual()`.  Luckily the desired behavior can be generated with
`scale_color_discrete()`.

# Examples
Note we use `type = cbep_colors()` wit h`scale_color_discrete(), not
`values = cbep_colors()`, as we did with `scale_color_manual()`.
```{r examples, fig.show="hold", out.width="30%"}
test <- ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(wt, mpg,colour = factor(cyl)), size = 3)
test +
  scale_color_discrete(breaks=c(4,8), 
                       name="Cylinders",
                       type = cbep_colors())
test +
  scale_color_manual(breaks=c(4,6,8),
                     name="Cylinders",
                     values = cbep_colors())

# But when we omit something from breaks, it gets replaced with the NA color
test +
  scale_color_manual(breaks=c(4,8), 
                     name="Cylinders",
                     values = cbep_colors())

```

## Fixing the Chlorophyll Y Axis
The Chlorophyll values we model and plot are actually a transformation of the  
raw chlorophyll observations.  As such, the values plotted are meaningless to 
potential readers.  We need to provide an axis that indicates the non-linearity
of the Y axis.

However, it **is** possible to define axis breaks and labels using functions.  
We can create a function to produce appropriate breaks and another to provide
labels for the Chlorophyll plot, if only we can construct a function that 
provides different values depending on the sub-plot we are in. 

We can tell which sub-plot we are in (here....) by looking at the axis limits,
which are passed as the argument to the `breaks` function.

Luckily, in our use case, the upper axis limit for the (transformed) chlorophyll
data is lower than any of the others.  The upper limit is around 5, while the 
next lowest maximum figure is well over 5.

A similar problem (and solution) faces setting the labels for the breaks. but
here, since we will have SET the breaks, we can look to see if we have those 
specific breaks, and if so, set the labels appropriately.  It's slightly
trickier than that, but that is the basic concept.

#### Create Functions
```{r make_funs}
prefered_breaks =  c(0, 1, 5, 10, 50)

my_breaks_fxn <- function(lims) {
  #browser()
  if(max(lims) < 5.1) {
    # Then we're looking at our transformed Chl data
  a <- prefered_breaks
    return(log(a +1))
  }
  else {
    return(labeling::extended(lims[[1]], lims[[2]], 5))
  }
}
```

We are cheating a bit here by plotting transformed data, but providing labels
that are back transformed.  That work is conducted by the labeling function.
```{r}
my_label_fxn <- function(brks) {
  # frequently, brks is passed with NA in place of one or more 
  # of the candidate brks, even after I pass a vector of breaks.
  # In particular, "pretty" breaks outside the range of the data
  # are dropped and replaced with NA.
  a <- prefered_breaks
  b <- round(log(a+1), 3)
  real_breaks = round(brks[! is.na(brks)], 3)
  if (all(real_breaks %in% b)) {
    # then we have our transformed Chl data
    return(a)
  }
  else {
    return(brks)
  }
}
``` 

## Jitter Plot
```{r jitter_base}
p_jit <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = station_name, y = value)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = bottom_flag), width = 0.3, height = 0, 
              alpha = 0.15) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = function(.x) median_hilow(.x, conf.int = .5),
               fill = cbep_colors()[3], color = "black",
               size = .4, shape = 22) +
  xlab('') +
  ylab('') +
  
  scale_y_continuous (breaks = my_breaks_fxn, labels = my_label_fxn) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,
                                   size = 8,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   vjust = 0),
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0, 'cm')) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

```{r jitter_colors, , fig.width = 3.5, fig.height = 9.5} 
p_jit +
  scale_color_discrete(type = cbep_colors()[c(1,4)], 
                     name = '', breaks = 'TRUE', label = 'Secchi On Bottom') +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3, alpha = 1))) +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_parm, nrow = 6,
             scale = 'free_y',
             labeller = label_parsed)

 ggsave('figures/surface_6_jitter_long_revised.pdf', device = cairo_pdf, 
        width = 3.5, height = 9.5)
```

```{r jitter_no_colors, , fig.width = 3.5, fig.height = 9.5} 
p_jit +
  scale_color_discrete(type = cbep_colors()[c(1,1)]) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  
  facet_wrap(~fancy_parm, nrow = 6,
             scale = 'free_y',
             labeller = label_parsed)

 ggsave('figures/surface_6_jitter_long_revised_no_color.pdf', device = cairo_pdf, 
        width = 3.5, height = 9.5)
```
