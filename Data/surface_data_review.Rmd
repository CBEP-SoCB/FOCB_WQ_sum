# Introduction
This Notebook reviews contents of the data received from FOCB's 
"'Citizen Stewards"Surface" data.

This reflects only a small portion of FOCB's monitoring activity.  

Other analyses in this SoCB GitHub repositories look
in more detail at:  
1.  "Historical "Citizen Steward" Data from nearly thirty years of monitoring.  
2.  Continuing sampling conducted at a smaller number of locations by FOCB
    staff. 
    
Analyses in OTHER GitHub archived look into the following:  
3.  Coastal acidification-related data collection at this same site.   
4.  Nutrient-related data, especially data on ambient nitrogen concentrations
    in and around Portland harbor.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(MASS)     # Here for the `boxcox()` function
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

library(GGally)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```


## Primary Data
We specify column names because FOCB data has a row of names, a row of units,
then the data.  This approach is simpler than reading names from the first
row and correcting them to be R syntactic names.
```{r load_data, warning = FALSE}
fn    <- 'FOCB Surface All Current Sites With BSV Data.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

mynames <- c('station', 'dt', 'time', 'sample_depth',
             'secchi', 'water_depth','temperature', 'salinity',
             'do', 'pctsat', 'pH', 'chl', 
             'month', 'year', 'fdom', 'bga', 
             'turbidity', 'blank', 'clouds', 'wndspd',
             'winddir'
             )

the_data <- read_excel(fpath, skip=2, col_names = mynames)
rm(mynames)
```

### Remove Data Only Availalbe In 2020
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
select(-c(fdom:winddir))
```

## Add Station Names
```{r}
fn    <- 'FOCB Monitoring Sites.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)
loc_data <- read_excel(fpath) %>%
  select(Station_ID, Station_Name) %>%
  rename(station = Station_ID)

the_data <- the_data %>%
  left_join(loc_data, by = 'station') %>%
  rename(station_name = Station_Name) %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station) %>%
  relocate(year, .after = dt) %>%
  relocate(month, .after = year)
```

## Address Censored Secchi Values
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(secchi_2 = if_else(secchi == "BSV", water_depth, as.numeric(secchi)),
         bottom_flag = secchi == "BSV") %>%
  relocate(secchi_2, .after = secchi) %>%
  relocate(bottom_flag, .after = secchi_2)
```

## Create Recent Data
We filter to the last five FULL years of data, 2015 through 2019.
```{r}
recent_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(year > 2014 & year < 2020) %>%
  mutate(station = factor(station))
```

## Create Trend Data
First, we create a tibble containing information on years in which each
station was sampled.
```{r}
years_data <- the_data %>%
  group_by(station, year) %>%
  summarize(yes = ! all(is.na(temperature)),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarize(years = sum(yes, na.rm = TRUE),
            recent_years =  sum(yes & year > 2014, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop')
  
```

Then we identify stations with at least 10 years of data, and at least three
years of data from the last five years, and use that list to select data for
trend analysis.
```{r}
selected_stations <- years_data %>%
  filter(years> 9, recent_years >2) %>%
  pull(station)

trend_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(station %in% selected_stations)
rm(selected_stations, years_data)
```

Two of the  Stations are not in the locations data.  They are:
"CMS2" and "P6CBI".  "P6CBI" was only sampled one year, in 2006.  CMS3 is a new
site in 2020, so does not play a role in a retrospective analysis.

# Cross Tabs
## Prevalence of Stations by Year
```{r}
xtabs(~ station + year, data = the_data)
```

## Prevalence of Parameters by Year
```{r}
tmp <- the_data %>%
  select(-dt, -time, -month, -sample_depth, 
         -secchi, - bottom_flag) %>%
  relocate(water_depth, .after = year) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(secchi_2:chl), names_to = 'parameter', values_to = 'value') %>%
  filter(! is.na(value)) %>%
  group_by(parameter)

xtabs(~ year + parameter, data = tmp)
rm(tmp)
```
So note that Chlorophyll data is available going back to 2001, but from 
relatively few samples until 2018

# Evaluation of Distributions
## Comment
We take a look at distributions of the data to help guide analyses.  But it
should be remembered that in this setting, viewing histograms and qq plots may 
be misleading, as they are based not on model residuals, but raw observations.

Some parameters, such as salinity, have very different distributions among
different sites, creating skewed overall distributions based on well understood
phenomena.  It is possible to have skewed distributions without ending up with 
skewed residuals.

## Pairs Plot
```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
the_data %>%
  select(c(-station, -station_name, 
           - dt, -time, 
           -sample_depth, 
           -secchi,  -bottom_flag,
           -month, - year)) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

Most of those variables are decently distributed for normal distribution-based 
models, although often with heavy tails.

Pairwise relationships are mostly reflections of the complex marine environment.
That is, low salinity happens inshore, where it is shallow, and water clarity
and dissolved oxygen both tend to be low. 

Water depth, salinity, and chlorophyll have significant problems with outliers.
Some of those extremes are related to specific Stations (e.g., deep water; 
low salinity).

The log transform over transforms many of these parameters.
It appears to make little difference for dissolved oxygen or pct saturation, and
clearly helps with chlorophyll.

## QQ Plots of Untransformed and Log-Transformed Data
```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
oldpar <-  par(mfrow = c(1,2))

for (p in c('secchi_2', 'temperature', 'salinity',
           'do', 'pctsat', 'pH', 'chl') ) {

qqnorm(the_data[[p]], main = p)
qqline(the_data[[p]])

l <- the_data[[p]]
l <- l[l>0]
l <- log(l)

qqnorm(l, main = paste('log of', p))
qqline(l)
}
par(oldpar)
  
  
```
All parameters show deviations from normality.  

*  Secchi depth is skewed right, with a long upper tail towards clear water. A 
   log transform is too strong a transformation, and over corrects, skewing 
   left.  
   
*  Temperature is heavy-tailed, which is not entirely surprising given data
   collected over the course of the warm season April through October.
   
*  Salinity is highly skewed, with a smallish number of very low salinity 
   observations.  Some are tied to specific locations in river mouths.  Based on 
   prior analyses, some are probably tied to low salinity events that extend 
   lower salinity conditions out into much of the Bay.
   
*  Dissolved Oxygen is close to normally distributed, with slightly heavy tails.

*  Percent Saturation has significantly heavier tails.

*  pH has a long lower tail.  Low pH events occur, rarely, and they are lower
   than expected based on a normal distribution.

*  Chlorophyll A is heavily skewed, with a small number of quite extreme high
   values.  The log transform improves matters, but the resulting distribution
   still has quite heavy tails.  The heavy tailed distribution suggests careful
   work may need to look at extreme value distributions, like a Pareto
   distribution, but that is impractical for the type of models envisioned here.

The only parameter for which the distribution is made clearly more suitable for
least squares modeling is  chlorophyll A.

## Box Cox Transformations 
The Box Cox transformation is based on looking at residuals from a linear model.
in this setting, the "default" linear model includes time of year and
monitoring Station

The box-cox transformations are of the form:
$$\frac{Y ^{\lambda} - 1}{\lambda}$$

But often Box Cox analysis is used to evaluate whether a power transform might
be approximately appropriate.

```{r}
for (p in c('secchi_2', 'temperature', 'salinity',
           'do', 'pctsat', 'pH', 'chl') ) {
  tmp <- the_data[the_data[[p]] > 0,]
the_lm <- lm(tmp[[p]] ~  tmp$station + tmp$month)

bc = boxcox(the_lm, lambda = seq(-0.5,2, 0.1), ylab = paste('loglik of', p))
}

rm(tmp)

```

*  Secchi might be variance-stabilized somewhat by a square root transform.
   There is no obvious scientific justification for a square root transform in 
   this setting.  
   
*  Chlorophyll A might be helped by a log transform.

*   None of the other parameters appear likely to be much helped by response
    transformations, at least not without getting fairly ad hoc.  While a 
    Box Cox transformation with Lambda == 1.25 may make statistical sense,
    for dissolved oxygen, it does not relate to any obvious physical 
    interpretation.  The value here is largely to remind us that for heavy-tailed
    distributions, power transformations can be variance stabilizing.

From an aesthetic data analysis point of view, power transformations appear 
unnecessary in the State of the Bay context, as we do not want to rely closely
on model assumption, and p values derived from them. Our sample sizes are 
generally large enough so that normal confidence intervals are likely to perform
fairly well.  But we probably need to interpret results with humility, and 
check results with robust methods.

```{r}
recent_data %>%
  select(c(-station, -station_name, - dt, -year, -month, -time,
           -sample_depth, -secchi)) %>%
  cor(method = 'spearman', use = 'pairwise')
```

# Secchi Depth Models
```{r fig.width = 7}
ggplot(recent_data, aes(water_depth, secchi_2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = water_depth - secchi_2 < 0.1)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = 'blue') +
  xlim(0,10)
```

We confirmed with Mike Doan, of Friends of Casco Bay that the "BSV" values in
the raw Secchi data means "Bottom Still Visible".  It indicates that the Secchi 
disk was on the bottom at the time of sampling.  We explore the implications 
of this in a separate notebook, "Secchi_Censored_Analysis.Rmd"  The bottom line
is that the (right) censored Secchi data biases Secchi results meaningfully
only at the most highly censored sites.
