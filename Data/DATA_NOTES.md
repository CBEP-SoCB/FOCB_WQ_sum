"FOCB Monitoring Sites SHORT NAMES.xlsx" is a hand edited version of 
"FOCB Monitoring Sites.xlsx", from the "Original_Data" folder.  The only
change is the addition of a column containing shorter names for FOCB
sampling locations, for use in SoCB.

"focb_monitoring_imperv.csv" contians results of GIS analysis of 
impervious cover in proximity to FOCB monitoring locations. Details are
provided in the data notes in the GIS folder.

"station_summary.csv" contains medians and means of recent FOCB water quality
data, by Station.  "Recent" here refers to the five year period 2015 through
2019. The data were derived in and exported from the
"Surface_Analysis_Recent.Rmd" notebook, in the "Analysis" folder. Details can be
found there.
